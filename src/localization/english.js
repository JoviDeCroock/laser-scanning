    introCopy: `EDS Systems is a team of passionate designers with a lot of experience in construction, they specialise in
    digital measurement and processing of buildings, monuments, industrial installations and infrastructure.
    This measurement could be performed together with a surveyor.`,
    laserScanner1: `3D laserscanning is a technique that allows us to measure buildings, ... in 3D and in a very short amount of time. 
    The scanner does not only perform detailed measurements, but it also makes panoramic images. That's why this technique is suited
    for the complexity of managing a project with an exact and reliable 3D representation of the current situation.
    The measurement is a suitable base for precise drawings and models.`,
    laserScanner2: `3D laserscanning can be applied for measuring buildings, monuments, industrial installations, infrastructure and so much more.
    This can be throughout the process of a building, before construction for a fast and correct measurement of the current situation with a low margin of error and realistic panoramic images;
    during the construction for as-built-, drainage- and contructionplans; and after the construction for as-built and control plans.`,
    pointcloud1: `Every point measured by the 3D scanner, is defined by a highly accurate x, y, z coordinate.
    All these points together form the pointcloud which will reflect the current situation accurately.
    This pointcloud forms the ideal base for processing them to detailed plans and models.
    The addition of panoramic images makes it possible for the user to get a better view of the scanned situation.
    This leads to a strong reduction in site visits and is a visual aid for consultation.`,
    plan1: `The acquired pointcloud will serve as a base for the creation of the siting plans, ground plans, detail plans, vertical intersections and facade views.
    the grade of detail will be discussed in advance (i.e. details of doors, windows, ornaments,...).`,
    model1: `The acquired pointcloud will serve as a base for the creation of our three dimensional models
    and visualizations. The grade of detail will be discussed in advance (i.e. details of doors, windows, ornaments,...).`
